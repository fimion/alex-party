Today's topic is Trig Functions. I feel like Trig Functions don't get a lot of love because nobody seems to know what 
you would actually use them for. I don't get to go over it in the talk very much. Let's actually show a 
demo of where you might want to use something like this.

The Trig functions that are now available are as follows:

- [`sin()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/sin)
- [`cos()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/cos)
- [`tan()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/tan)
- [`asin()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/asin)
- [`acos()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/acos)
- [`atan()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/atan)
- [`atan2()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/atan2)
