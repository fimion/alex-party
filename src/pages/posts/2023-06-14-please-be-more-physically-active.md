Alright, I'll admit I am the least qualified person to talk about this. But as a mediocre white guy in tech on the internet, I'm going to share my experience.

### A bit of backstory

I don't work out. I should. All of my doctors agree on that point. In fact, all of those doctors would be pleased if I just started walking a little each day. But my brain is bad, and it thinks that taking a walk is the equivalent of summiting Everest. Everytime I consider any form of physical activity, my brain goes “Ew, no.”

In a previous career, I spent lots of time pushing boxes, climbing ladders, regularly lifting 20lb lighting fixtures over my head, and this type of activity kept my body in pretty okay shape. Was I the most fit? No. But at least i was moving. A lot.

Moving over into the Web Dev space, I stopped moving. Like, pretty much entirely. This was/is my downfall. 

A year+ ago I went to see a physical therapist (PT) for the first time. My wrist was always in pain, and ~~I figured it wouldn't hurt to talk to a professional~~ (let's be honest) my wife told me to go see her PT. We worked through some stuff, the wrist got better, cool. Then, other things started to hurt. 

### Reality sets in

The way my PT at the time explained it to me was this: Most people end up in physical therapy because they have over-extended something. They've done too much. And in doing so, they've hurt themselves.

***However***, There is also the other end of the spectrum, where someone does absolutely nothing at all to the point where the body starts falling apart (not literally, I hope). _This is where I am, and let me tell you, it sucks._

### Whatcha gonna do?

This is where I'm supposed to be inspirational and stuff, right?

> “Just lift one thing at a time!”

or maybe:

> “No one ever regrets working out!"

Most platitudes don't work when your brain won't cooperate. I genuinely have no idea what I'm gonna do, nor do I have any life altering advice I can give. The only thing I can tell you is what I get told by everyone:

> “Please, just move more.”

Don't let your body fall apart.
