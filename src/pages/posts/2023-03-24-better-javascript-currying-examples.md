I'll admit I went on a bit of a rant the other day on this topic because I find the way people are taught about currying is typically with the least useful examples ever. This is in part because of the push for the functional programming paradigm in JavaScript (which until we have [Records and Tuples](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-record-tuple) will continue to be laughable, in my opinion)
