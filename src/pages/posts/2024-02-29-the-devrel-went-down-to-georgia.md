## The DevRel Went Down to Georgia

(to the tune of [The Charlie Daniels Band's “The Devil Went Down to Georgia”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBjPAqmnvGA))

> The DevRel went down to Georgia, they had some code to shill<br>They were in a bind, cause they were way behind, and the VP wasn't thrilled<br>When they came upon this young dev pushing to main and cursing a lot<br>The DevRel sat right down and said, "Hey let me tell you what,<br><br>"You probably didn't know it but I've pushed main a time or two,<br>And if you care to have a share, I'll make a deal with you,<br>The thing my company makes can solve your primary issue,<br>I'll bet a sticker of gold against your role that it'll make it faster too."<br>The dev said "My names Sally and I've got stand-up in ten,<br>But if you wait, I can give an update, and then we can begin"<br><br>Sally commit and push your code and submit a new PR,<br>Cause the tests won't fail in CI, and the DevRel has a card<br>and if you wait, you'll win this shiny sticker made of gold<br>and if you leave, the DevRel gets your role<br><br>The DevRel opened up their mac, and said "I'll start this show"<br>And fire flew from their finger tips as they began to git clone<br>And they pulled a branch, and started to talk about their business<br>Then a band of recruiters joined in, and it sounded something like this<br><br>[insert amazing guitar/banjo/fiddle solo, overlaid with someone discussing some kind of generic developer product with a chorus of recruiter ooh-ing and ahhh-ing, and miscellaneous keyboard sounds]<br><br>Now when the DevRel finished, Sally said, "That's a pretty good dry run,<br>But come sit down in the chair right there, and let me show you my problem."<br><br>Fire up some docker, npm run<br>Add a little python, rust for fun<br>C Sharp in the backend, layer in some go<br>Tie it all together with a bit of "No Code"<br><br>Well, the DevRel bowed their head because they knew they can't compete<br>And they laid that golden sticker down as they got up from their seat<br>Sally said, "DevRel, don't feel too bad, or lose any morale,<br>The tool seems cool, I like your pitch, but I need it to support pascal!"<br><br>Fire up some docker, npm run<br>Add a little python, rust for fun<br>C Sharp in the backend, layer in some go<br>Tie it all together with a bit of "No Code"
