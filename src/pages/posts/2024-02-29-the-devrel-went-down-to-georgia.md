## The DevRel Went Down to Georgia

(to the tune of [The Charlie Daniels Band's “The Devil Went Down to Georgia”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBjPAqmnvGA))

```
The DevRel went down to Georgia, they had some code to shill 
They were in a bind, cause they were way behind, and the VP wasn't thrilled
When they came upon this young dev pushing to main and cursing a lot
The DevRel sat right down and said, "Hey let me tell you what,

"You probably didn't know it but I've pushed main a time or two,
And if you care to have a share, I'll make a deal with you,
The thing my company makes can solve your primary issue,
I'll bet a sticker of gold against your role that it'll make it faster too."
The dev said "My names Sally and I've got stand-up in ten,
But if you wait, I can give an update, and then we can begin"

Sally commit and push your code and submit a new PR,
Cause the tests won't fail in CI, and the DevRel has a card
and if you wait, you'll win this shiny sticker made of gold
and if you leave, the DevRel gets your role

The DevRel opened up their mac, and said "I'll start this show"
And fire flew from their finger tips as they began to git clone
And they pulled a branch, and started to talk about their business
Then a band of recruiters joined in, and it sounded something like this

[insert amazing guitar/banjo/fiddle solo, overlaid with someone discussing some kind of generic developer product with a chorus of recruiter ooh-ing and ahhh-ing, and miscellaneous keyboard sounds]

Now when the DevRel finished, Sally said, "That's a pretty good dry run,
But come sit down in the chair right there, and let me show you my problem."

Fire up some docker, npm run
Add a little python, rust for fun
C Sharp in the backend, layer in some go
Tie it all together with a bit of "No Code"

Well, the DevRel bowed their head because they knew they can't compete
And they laid that golden sticker down as they got up from their seat
Sally said, "DevRel, don't feel too bad, or lose any morale,
The tool seems cool, I like your pitch, but I need it to support pascal!"

Fire up some docker, npm run
Add a little python, rust for fun
C Sharp in the backend, layer in some go
Tie it all together with a bit of "No Code"
