I'm setting up some automations, and I'm hoping that I'll be able to let folks know more effectively what it is that I'm writing about and doing lately.

I'm doing this automation using [IFTTT](https://ifttt) and hopefully (if this goes right) it'll post to twitter, mastodon, and linkedin.

Sorry linked in folks if y'all came here and were blinded by the sudden flash of colors and Comic Neue. I promise, I do write about many technology related topics usually.
